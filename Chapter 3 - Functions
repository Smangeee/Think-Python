# Exercise 3.3
# Python provides a built-in function called len that returns the length of a string, so the value of len('allen') is 5. Write a function named right_justify that takes a string named s as a parameter and prints the string with enough leading spaces so that the last letter of the string is in column 70 of the display.

def right_justify(s):
    print(' ' * (70-len(s))+s)
    
right_justify('allen')

# Exercise 3.4
# A function object is a value you can assign to a variable or pass as an argument. For example, do_twice is a function that takes a function object as an argument and calls it twice:

def do_twice(f):
  f()
  f()
  
# Here's an example that uses do_twice to call a function named print_spam twice.

def print_spam():
  print('spam')
  
do_twice(print_spam)

print("\n")

# Modify do_twice so that it takes two arguments, a function object and a value, and calls the function twice, passing the value as an argument.

def do_twice(f, num):
  f(num)
  f(num)
  
# Write a more general version of print_spam, called print_twice, that takes a string as a parameter and prints it twice.

def print_twice(spam):
  print(spam)
  print(spam)
  
# Use the modified version of do_twice to call print_twice twice, passing 'spam' as an argument.

do_twice(print_twice, 'spam')

print("\n")

# Define a new function called do_four that takes a function object and a value and calls the function four times, passing the value as a parameter. There should be only two statements in the body of this function, not four.

def do_four(f, num):
  print(do_twice(f, num))
  print(do_twice(f, num))
  
do_four(print_twice, 'spam')


# Exercise 3.5
# I'm sure there are more efficient ways, but I did this myself :)  -- Not sure how to remove the words "None" that appear after the column_4times(column) function is used.

# row:   +----+----+
half_row = ('+' + ('-' * 4))
row = half_row * 2

# bar lines:    |    |    |     (repeated for 4 lines)
def column_4times(column):
    print(column)
    print(column)
    print(column)
    print(column)  
    
half_column = ('|' + ' ' * 4)
column = (half_column * 2 + '|')

print(row + '+')
print(column_4times(column))
print(row + '+')
print(column_4times(column))
print(row + '+')
