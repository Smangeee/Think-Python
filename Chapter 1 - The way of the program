# If you run a 10 kilometer race in 43 minutes 30 seconds, what is your average time per mile? What is your average speed in miles per hour? (Hint: there are about 1.61 kilometers in a mile).

# Convert km to miles.
race_length = 10/1.61

# Average time per mile?
av_time = 43.5/race_length
print(av_time)

# Average speed in mph:
av_speed = 60/av_time
print(av_speed)




# More efficient code [from wikibooks]
print round((10/1.61)/(43.5/60), 2)
