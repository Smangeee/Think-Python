# Exercise 2.2

width = 17
height = 12.0
delimiter = '.'

one = width/2
print(one)
print(type(one))

two = width/2.0
print(two)
print(type(two))

three = height/3
print(three)
print(type(three))

four = 1 + 2 * 5
print(four)
print(type(four))

five = delimiter * 5
print(five)
print(type(five))

# Exercise 2.3

# 1. The volume of a sphere with radius r is 4/3 Ï€ r**3. What is the volume of a sphere with radius 5?
import math
pi = math.pi
r = 5
v = 4/3*pi*r**3
print(v)

# 2. Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount. Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies?
# ----> book = 24.95 - (24.95 * 0.4)  <----- why does this give "14.969999999999999" as an answer?
book = 24.95
discount = 9.98
# ----> book = book - discount = 14.9699999999?? Why? <-----
book = 14.97
copies = 60
book_cost = book * copies
delivery = 3

Figure out what's up before moving on with this.

# 3. If I leave my house at 6:52 am and run 1 mile at an easy pace (8:15 per mile), then 3 miles at tempo (7:12 per mile) and 1 mile at easy pace again, what time do I get home for breakfast?
